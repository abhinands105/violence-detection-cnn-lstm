# Violence Detection using CNN + LSTM 🚨

This project is a complete deep learning pipeline to detect violence in videos using frame sequences. It uses a CNN + LSTM model trained on the [RWF-2000 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vulamnguyen/rwf2000) and includes adversarial testing, real-time alerts, and environmental robustness checks.
